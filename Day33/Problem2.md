# Right Side View of Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, imagine standing on the **right side** of it. Return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

This is a classic tree traversal problem that requires collecting the **rightmost node at each level** of the tree.

## Example

**Input:**
```

```
   1
  / \
 2   3
  \   \
   5   4
```

````

**Output:** `[1, 3, 4]`

## Approach

### âœ… Algorithm Used: Breadth-First Search (Level Order Traversal)

We use a **queue** to perform **level-order traversal (BFS)** and keep track of the last node at each level, since it is the node visible from the right side.

### ðŸ§  Steps:
1. Initialize an empty result vector to store right side view.
2. Use a `queue<TreeNode*>` to process nodes level by level.
3. For each level:
   - Count how many nodes are in the level (`levelSize`).
   - Traverse all nodes in that level.
   - Add the **last nodeâ€™s value** to the result list (this is the rightmost node of that level).
4. Return the result list.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;
        if (root == nullptr) return result;

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* curr = q.front();
                q.pop();

                // If it's the last node in the level, add to result
                if (i == levelSize - 1) {
                    result.push_back(curr->val);
                }

                if (curr->left) q.push(curr->left);
                if (curr->right) q.push(curr->right);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

## Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

  * Each node is visited once.

* **Space Complexity:** `O(w)`

  * Where `w` is the **maximum width** of the tree (number of nodes in the largest level), due to queue storage.

## Key Concepts

* Binary Tree
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Level Order Traversal
* Queue Data Structure
* Rightmost Node Detection

---

## Alternative Approaches

* **DFS (Depth-First Search)** with reverse preorder traversal (Root â†’ Right â†’ Left) and tracking levels can also solve this problem.
